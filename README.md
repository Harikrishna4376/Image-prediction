# Image-prediction
Image prediction using convolutional neural network

It uses Convolutional Neural Networks to predict what exactly is inside the image. 
it uses pre-trained model named ResNet101 meaning it uses 101 layers of neural networks that act like brain to predict the output of the image
and tells us what exactly is the image of, like an animal, object, name of the object.
